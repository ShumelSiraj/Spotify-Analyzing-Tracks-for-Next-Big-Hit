# Spotify Track Success Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to develop predictive models to forecast the success of tracks on Spotify. It leverages a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes of tracks released on the platform up to 2023, including artist information, release dates, presence in playlists, streams, and musical features like danceability, energy, and valence.

## Project Structure
- `Spotify_Predictive_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used in the project. Due to size constraints, only a sample of the dataset (`spotify-2023.csv`) is included here.
- `docs/`: Documentation of the methodology, models, and findings.
- `scripts/`: Any additional scripts used for data preprocessing, analysis, etc.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python packages required to run the project.
